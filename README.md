# Exercise

For this exercise, I used JS and some NodeJS.


## Task

I successfully completed the first of the two tasks which was to return all of the transitive
   dependencies for a package, not only the first order dependencies, due to personal time constraints. 


To install dependencies and start the server in development mode:

```sh
npm ci
npm start
```
